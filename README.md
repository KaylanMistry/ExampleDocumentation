Milestone 1

Created a Scraper and methods to navigate through the chosen site  - 'Fishwatch'.  This included creating a method to click on all profiles of the fish and gathering the url for each profile within a method. I confirmed this worked as I used the 'print' function to display each fish url. I then created a __name__ varibale which only allowed code to be run from a 'bot' which can call different methods at any time.
