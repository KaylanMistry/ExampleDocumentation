Milestone 1
Downloaded the model to my system and added this to VS Code to begin the process for my project.

Milestone 2
Created a virtual environment to prevent and disruptions between this project and any others using 'conda'. Additionally, I got familiar with the code I was using by using the lessons to help me.

Milestone 3
Created finctions to allow player and computer to 'choose' rock, paper or scissors using the 'prediction' function for the player and creating a 'random' variable for the computer. Using the basic code I could run the game using the 'print' function on python to dsiplay the choices.#

Milestone 4
Creating a countdown to give the user time to show thir hand using global variables 'elapsed' to determine the amount of time passed and importing the 'time' variable to create a version of the time I could use.  I created a variable 'counter' to equate the time to '0' to allow me to use it in a timer type function.  Editing this to start when the game begins, I used times 7 seconds to allow the user to pick either R,P,S.  After this I created a time to show which variable the user and computer picked, then another to display who won/lost/draw.  I needed to create global varibale to ensure the programme only picked up the choices once 'c'. Afterwards, I created 'started' as a variable and 'start' and 'next round' keys to create pauses in the code for user interaction.
